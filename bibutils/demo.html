<H1> bib2html demo </H1>

<P> 

<B>bib2html</B> is a combination of a shell script and two
BibTeX-style files.  bib2html takes the name of a style and a list of
.bib file names, and runs BibTeX to produce an output file bib.html.
This demo page assumes that you have run either
<CODE> bib2html alpha demo.bib </CODE>
or 
<CODE> bib2html abstract demo.bib, </CODE> 
and that the output 
<A HREF="bib.html"> bib.html </A>
remains in the same directory as this
file.  (Note: the abstracting style will often produce some warning
messages from bibtex if the abstracts or comments are too long, but
the resulting HTML is still usable.)
</P>

<P> 

One of the neat things about bib2html is that you can put a <EM> URL
</EM> field in your bib entries, and that URL will be used to make the
entry's label into a Web link.  Usually, the URL would point to the
paper itself (e.g., compressed postscript in an ftp archive, or
perhaps even an HTML-format paper), but it could of course point to
anything.  Thus you can expand your idea of what bib entries might
reference....

</P>

<P> 

One of the other neat things about bib2html is that you can put
citations to the bibliography in other pages, much like you can in
LaTeX.  The difference is that the citations are <EM>links</EM> to the
bibliography page.  For example, I can refer one of my recent papers
in the demo bibliography

<A HREF="bib.html#kotz:addrtrace"> [KC94b]. </A> 
(View the source of this page to see how it's done).  That one has the
paper's text on-line.  My PhD thesis is
<A HREF="bib.html#kotz:thesis"> [Kot91]. </A> 
Another paper does not have any on-line version
<A HREF="bib.html#kotz:pools"> [KE89]. </A> 

</P>

<P>

Notice that I use the cite key for the anchor label, rather than the
label chosen by BibTeX.  This has two main benefits: it makes the
citation (URL) more like that in LaTeX, and it makes the citation
independent of the format of the bibliography page (and the way it
chooses labels).

</P>

<P>

One disadvantage is that there is no way to automatically generate the
citation labels at the point of reference, like BibTeX's
cross-referencing capability.  Another disadvantage is that bib2html
doesn't understand arbitrary LaTeX commands.  Although it converts
most accents, \bf, \em, etc to HTML, 
any fancier embedded LaTeX or TeX commands are just
passed through.  If you need a pretty bibliography,
you'll have to edit those by hand.
